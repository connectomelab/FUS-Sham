# FUS-Sham
Auditory stimulus for recreate auditory artifact for Sham-FUS

We used a Matlab script to generate a .wav file with pulses of a 20 kHz tone (sine wave). Pulse duration, pulse repetition interval, and total duration of a session were identical to the experimental ultrasound stimulation protocol. The exported .wav file was played using a bone-conducting headphone during the sham stimulation. 

**#ultrasound_sham.m**: Matlab file generating rectangular pulses (no ramping)

**#ultrasound_sham.wav**: example output of the routine above.
